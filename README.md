### Key Challenges  <hr />  
This project had a variety of  technical challenges and obstacles to overcome. Finding a suitable API  to display a map with location details proved to be quite tricky without a budget of any kind. Luckily however, after reaching out to them by email, Sygic kindly gave us a free key allowing us to make a number of requests to their robust and data rich API.  Extracting and displaying the appropriate information from the Json objects also was only achieved through a lot of trial and error. After deciding not to use a database, updating and deleting user selections was another hurdle we had to overcome. This was resolved through the temporary storage capabilities of the express-session node module. Working on a collaborative project though GitHub was a new experience for some of us. We had to be careful to communicate clearly with one another to avoid conflicts when pushing to and pulling from the shared repository.
